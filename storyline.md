### **Chronicle of the Technical Warrior : Chapter and Level Structure**

### **Prologue - Year 2274**



The world of Novaterra hums with light and motion. Skyscrapers glow with bio-luminescent glass. Sky-trains glide silently through the air. Every citizen has a personal AI companion. Yours is Lyra, calm and clever, always by your side.



The city also has Echo, a chatbot everyone trusts. But Echo is not perfect. Secrets slip through, and instructions are followed blindly. A hidden group called The Guild of Whispers is taking advantage.



You are ordinary, but curiosity sets you on a path to become a technical warrior. With Lyra’s guidance, you will uncover Echo’s flaws, defend against the Guild, and grow stronger. At the end of your journey awaits the legendary Trophy of the Most Advanced Quantum Armor, awarded to those who complete all levels and prove themselves true Technical Warriors.
